# ü§ñ Binance P2P & Market Data Telegram Bot

A powerful and easy-to-use Telegram bot built with Python for quick access to Binance P2P offers and real-time market data. This bot helps you monitor P2P rates for **USDT/ETB** and get instant crypto conversions and coin details without needing to open the Binance app.

-----

## ‚ú® Features

The bot provides a set of simple commands to get the information you need, fast.

  - `/start` & `/help`: Get a welcome message and a list of available commands.
  - `/p2p_usdt_top [buy|sell]`: Shows the top P2P offers for the USDT \<-\> ETB pair. By default, it displays **BUY** offers.
  - `/p2p_usdt_amount <amount><unit> [buy|sell]`: Lists the top 10 P2P offers for a specific amount.
      - *Examples:* `/p2p_usdt_amount 5000ETB` or `/p2p_usdt_amount 50USDT sell`
  - `/convert <from_symbol> <to_symbol> [amount]`: Converts one cryptocurrency to another.
      - *Examples:* `/convert BTC USDT 0.01` or `/convert TON SOL 10`
  - `/coininfo <symbol>`: Displays basic market information for a given cryptocurrency, including its current price, market cap, and 24-hour change.

### üìù Notes

  - P2P data is fetched from the Binance P2P endpoint used by their web UI (no API key required).
  - Public market price data is fetched from Binance public REST endpoints. CoinGecko is used as a fallback for metadata where necessary.
